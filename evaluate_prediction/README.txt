Set of script code to evaluate the performance and accurancy of the prediction related to the calibration zone.
Do it in batch for multiple range (zone) by selecting the folder with parameter "sel.mod" in the script

Contains
========
- bound_pred_var_v1.1.R: Calculate the boundaries values for the all predictings values in a new range
- eval_flase_neg_v1.R: Evaluate for the false negative area which predicting variables is not satisfied
- eval_pred_new_range_v1.1.R: Evaluate the model prediction performance in a new range 
				on similarity predicting analysis (MESS index) and 
				on evaluate the capacity to predict new range (Boyce index)
